# Hotel Booking App

This is a simple React-based hotel booking application that allows users to:

1. Select a hotel and book it with a guest name.
2. View a confirmation message after successful booking.
3. Clear all bookings from the backend JSON server.

## Features

- **Hotel Selection and Booking**: Users can select a hotel and provide their guest name to book it.
- **Booking Confirmation**: After successful booking, a personalized confirmation message is displayed.
- **Clear All Bookings**: Users can delete all bookings from the backend.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages for booking and deletion failures.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **React Query**: For data fetching, mutations, and caching.
- **Zustand**: For managing global client-side state.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend JSON server.
- **JSON Server**: Mock backend server for testing API requests.
